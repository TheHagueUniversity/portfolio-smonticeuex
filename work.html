	     <h3> The Digital Sparkler  </h3>
		  <P>For the final day of a 5 day coding bootcamp, I wanted to show all the things I have learned throughout the week, but also incorporate things that I have studied at home during my own time. For this coding project I was inspired to create something simple but pretty. As we were nearing the Holiday season, I wanted to code virtual fireworks that the user can control. The inspiration for this sketch is the sparkler fireworks that you can draw in the air with when it is lit.</p>
		  <P>To ultimately reach my goal I had created the sparkling effect by having the colors of the ellipses change in random colors while the mouse is pressed. The interactivity happens when the user moves the mouse to start drawing. And lastly, the fading effect is achieved when you continuously keep drawing. Eventually the snake’s tail will start to fade.</p>

	     <h3> Alien vs Asteroids  </h3>
		 <p>On the fourth day of an intense 1 week Programming bootcamp for the User Experience Design course, we were asked to use Processing to code a game with characters, obstacles and challenges. </p>
		 <p> Inspired by space invaders I wanted to add my own twist to that classic game story. My main character (blue square) is  an alien who is travelling through space but has many oncoming asteroids to avoid.</p>
		 <p>Learning about array elements really helped me to group my “enemies” (asteroids) together in a more efficient way. I used for loops to have the asteroids endlessly re-appear each time a little bit faster, which makes the game all the more challenging. </p>

	     <h3> Hallmark's Digital Gift Unwrapping Experience </h3>
		  <p> This was my first time presenting my work as a designer to an actual client. The bespoke project was done for Hallmark CE in an attempt to make the digital unwrapping experience of intangible gifts more exciting. During this project I was able to be a part of every design phase from emphatizing to testing. </p>
		  <p>Together with my partner we came up with a digital unwrapping experience for our persona ;an ambitious soccer fanatic who needs to feel relatedness because thoughtful presentation and timing makes him feel loved and cared about, while unwrapping the gift. I was aiming for the element of surprise throughout the whole design vision, but I really wanted to make that clear during the digital unwrapping. I also wanted to find a way to help motivate the persona, and what better way than a challenging game?! Just as he has to overcome his challenges to achieve his goals and dreams.</p>

	    <h3> User Experience Designer Toolkit  </h3>
		<p> This toolkit was created at the start of my journey as a user experience designer. It's meant to serve as a place where the designer can have an overview of the techniques that is learned throughout their careers. </p>
		<p> The app includes a log-in screen that then leads to the kit. The toolbox includes diverging, converging and iterating tchniques that the designer can always refer to whenever they are feeling stuck. </p>
